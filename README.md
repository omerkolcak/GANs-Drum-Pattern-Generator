# Generative Adversarial Networks - Drum Pattern Generation
I love listening metal music, and especially black metal. In this project, I tried to generate similar drum patterns of my whole time favorite black metal drummer Maciej Kowalski aka Darkside from MG≈ÅA. In order to achieve this, Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs) are used. This project covers the following steps:
* Data Collection
* Data Preprocessing
* Model Training

You can listen couple of generated tracks by following this [link](https://soundcloud.com/oemer-faruk-kolcak/sets/ai-generated-darkside-drums).
